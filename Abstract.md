##### Abstract

As more and more apps start to use QR codes, being able to find the correct QR code and open it in a short time has become the demand of most people today. 

At present, people can open the app through the voice assistant, but in public places, the voice assistant may not detect or even misunderstand the instructions. Moreover, the user might be a little embarrassed to speak to voice assistant in public. 

Therefore, we designed a “Instant Call-out” app for Huawei smart glasses, which can free users’ hands, and easily activate the QR code they want by interacting with the glasses through certain gestures. Comparing with the voice assistant, our app could detect and understand users’ instructions more accurately regardless of ambient noise in public.

Finally, we tested our APP and found that opening the QR code through glasses can be about 10s faster than before, saving nearly 87% of the time.
